# crobots-robots
robots for the crobots programming game

Circles.r is my own design, and it is better in some ways than sniper.r. See scores.txt and scores2.txt.

The purpose of this ropesitory is the following:Adding a robot is not a new version of Crobots (current newest version is at https://github.com/smeagolthellama/crobots), so shouldn't mean an update to that repository.

At least, that is my own opinion. Others are allowed to disagree.

Feel free to add more robots, but please keep things organized.
